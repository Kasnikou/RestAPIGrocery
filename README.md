This project is a comprehensive Grocery Management System for Gelos Enterprise, built using JavaScript with Node.js, Express.js, HTML, and CSS, and connected to a MongoDB NoSQL database. The application allows users to manage grocery inventory and operations efficiently, including displaying product details, adding new items, borrowing and returning products, and deleting records. The system ensures high performance and scalability through effective partitioning and indexing, and includes features for handling high concurrency and ensuring data durability. Additionally, it incorporates robust security measures with JWT-based authentication and authorization, and includes automated API documentation using Swagger UI.
